    "**Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression is a regression technique used to reduce overfitting in linear regression models. It is an extension of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ordinary least squares regression, the goal is to minimize the sum of squared residuals between the predicted values and the actual values. OLS estimates the regression coefficients that best fit the data by finding the values that minimize the sum of squared residuals. However, OLS does not account for multicollinearity, which can lead to unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates when predictors are highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression addresses this issue by adding a penalty term to the OLS objective function. The penalty term introduces a shrinkage factor that constrains the coefficient estimates, reducing their magnitude. This penalty term is a multiple of the squared magnitude of the coefficients (excluding the intercept term), multiplied by a tuning parameter called lambda (λ). Lambda controls the amount of shrinkage applied to the coefficients."

    "**Q2. What are the assumptions of Ridge Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linearity: Ridge Regression assumes a linear relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable. The model assumes that the relationship between the predictors and the response can be adequately captured by a linear combination of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Independence: The observations used in Ridge Regression should be independent of each other. Independence means that the error terms or residuals for different observations should not be correlated. If there is correlation among the residuals, it violates the assumption of independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity: Ridge Regression assumes that the variance of the error terms is constant across all levels of the predictor variables. Homoscedasticity implies that the spread or dispersion of the residuals remains constant throughout the range of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No multicollinearity: Ridge Regression assumes that the predictor variables are not highly correlated with each other. Multicollinearity occurs when there is a high correlation between two or more predictor variables, which can lead to unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates. Ridge Regression is specifically used to address the issue of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normality: Ridge Regression assumes that the error terms or residuals follow a normal distribution. This assumption is necessary to perform hypothesis testing, construct confidence intervals, and obtain reliable p-values for the coefficient estimates."

    "- Fit a Ridge Regression model using a range of λ values or perform a grid search to evaluate different λ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze the coefficient estimates obtained from Ridge Regression for each predictor. The magnitude of the coefficient estimates indicates the importance of each predictor in the model. Higher absolute values indicate higher importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify predictors with relatively large coefficient estimates, as they have a stronger impact on the response variable. These predictors are considered more important or influential.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select the subset of predictors that are deemed important based on the analysis of coefficient estimates. You can choose a threshold value for the coefficient magnitude or use other criteria to determine the subset of predictors to keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optionally, you can further refine the selected subset using additional techniques, such as univariate feature selection, recursive feature elimination, or domain knowledge."

Time-series data typically exhibit autocorrelation, where observations at different time points are dependent on each other. Therefore, standard Ridge Regression techniques need to be adapted to consider the temporal structure in the data."
