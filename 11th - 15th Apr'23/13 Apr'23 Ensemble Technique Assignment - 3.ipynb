    "### Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method used for regression tasks. It is an extension of the Random Forest algorithm, which is primarily used for classification problems. In Random Forest Regressor, instead of predicting discrete class labels, the model predicts continuous numeric values."

    "### Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting by employing two main techniques: bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) and random feature selection. These strategies help to create an ensemble of diverse decision trees, which work together to make more robust predictions while mitigating the tendency of individual trees to overfit to the training data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees through a simple averaging mechanism. Once the ensemble of decision trees is trained on different subsets of the data and the model is ready for prediction, the individual predictions of all trees are combined to make the final prediction for the regression task."

    "### Q4. What are the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "**n_estimators:** This hyperparameter specifies the number of decision trees to be included in the ensemble (Random Forest). Increasing the number of trees can improve performance, but it also increases computation time. A typical range for n_estimators is 50 to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "**max_depth:** It sets the maximum depth allowed for each decision tree in the ensemble. Restricting the depth helps prevent overfitting. If not specified, decision trees are expanded until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**min_samples_split:** This hyperparameter determines the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node during the construction of a decision tree. It controls the depth of the trees and influences overfitting. A higher value leads to simpler trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**min_samples_leaf:** It specifies the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. Like min_samples_split, it influences the complexity of the trees and helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**max_features:** This parameter controls the number of features to consider when looking for the best split at each node. It can be an integer representing the exact number of features or a float representing a fraction of the total features to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "**bootstrap:** It determines whether bootstrap samples are used when building decision trees. If set to True, bootstrap sampling is used (default). If set to False, the whole dataset is used to train each decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**random_state:** This parameter allows you to set a seed for the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**n_jobs:** The number of CPU cores to use for training and prediction. Setting it to -1 uses all available cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**oob_score:** If set to True, the model will use out-of-bag (OOB) samples to estimate the R-squared score during training, which serves as a cross-validation metric."

    "### Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Tree Regressor:** A decision tree regressor is a single tree-based model that recursively splits the data into subsets based on the values of input features. Each internal node of the tree represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents a numeric value (the predicted output). The tree is constructed by recursively finding the best splits to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) or another suitable regression criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest Regressor:** A random forest regressor is an ensemble model that consists of multiple decision trees (often hundreds or even thousands). Each decision tree is independently trained on a different bootstrap sample of the training data. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all individual trees."

    "### Q6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of Random Forest Regressor:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Robustness:** Random Forest Regressor is more robust compared to a single decision tree. It can handle noisy and complex datasets effectively and is less prone to overfitting due to the averaging effect of multiple trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Accuracy:** Random Forest Regressor often provides higher accuracy compared to a single decision tree, especially when the dataset is large or contains a large number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handles Non-Linear Relationships:** Random Forest Regressor can capture non-linear relationships between input features and the target variable, making it suitable for a wide range of regression problems.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lack of Interpretability:** The ensemble of decision trees in Random Forest makes the model less interpretable compared to a single decision tree. It may be challenging to explain the model's decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory and Computational Cost:** Training a large number of decision trees can be memory-intensive and computationally expensive, especially for very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Random Forest has several hyperparameters that need to be tuned for optimal performance, which can be time-consuming and require careful cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Size Bias:** Random Forest may favor features with more categories or higher cardinality during tree construction, leading to a potential bias towards such features."

    "\n",
    "The output of Random Forest Regressor is a continuous numerical value. As a regression model, Random Forest Regressor predicts numeric values rather than discrete class labels, which is the case for classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use Random Forest Regressor to make predictions on new data, it will generate a predicted numeric value for each data point in the test set. The predicted values are continuous and represent the model's estimation of the target variable (the dependent variable) based on the input features (the independent variables) provided for each data point."
